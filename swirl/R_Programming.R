> TRUE & c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
# [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE


# the left operand is only evaluated with the first member of the right operand (the vector). The rest of the elements in the vector aren't evaluated at all in this expression.
> TRUE && c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
# [1] TRUE


> TRUE | c(TRUE,FALSE, FALSE)
# [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE



> TRUE || c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
# [1] TRUE



# As you may recall, arithmetic has an order of operations and so do logical expressions. All AND operators are evaluated before OR operators. Let's look at an example of an ambiguous case
> 5 > 8 || 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9
# [1] TRUE



# The function isTRUE() takes one argument. If that argument evaluates to TRUE, the function will return TRUE. Otherwise, the function will return FALSE.
> isTRUE(6 > 4)
# [1] TRUE




# identical() will return TRUE if the two R objects passed to it as arguments are identical.
> identical('twins', 'twins')
# [1] TRUE




# You should also be aware of the xor() function, which takes two arguments. The xor() function stands for exclusive OR. If one argument evaluates to TRUE and one argument evaluates to FALSE, then this function will return TRUE, otherwise it will return FALSE.
> xor(5 == 6, !FALSE)
# [1] TRUE



> ints <- sample(10)
# to find the indices of ints that are greater than 7
> which(ints > 7)
# [1] 1 4 7 # the <ints> created randomely, so probeably you get diffrent indices


# any() and all() take logical vectors as their argument. The any() function will return TRUE if one or more of the elements in the logical vector is TRUE. The all() function will return TRUE if every element in the logical vector is TRUE.
> any(ints < 0)
# [1] FALSE


> all(ints > 0)
# [1] TRUE

# The syntax for creating new binary operators in R is unlike anything else in
# R, but it allows you to define a new syntax for your function. I would only
# recommend making your own binary operator if you plan on using it often!
#
# User-defined binary operators have the following syntax:
#      %[whatever]% 
# where [whatever] represents any valid variable name.
# 
# Let's say I wanted to define a binary operator that multiplied two numbers and
# then added one to the product. An implementation of that operator is below:
#
# "%mult_add_one%" <- function(left, right){ # Notice the quotation marks!
#   left * right + 1
# }
#
# I could then use this binary operator like `4 %mult_add_one% 5` which would
# evaluate to 21.
#
# Write your own binary operator below from absolute scratch! Your binary
# operator must be called %p% so that the expression:
#
#       "Good" %p% "job!"
#
# will evaluate to: "Good job!"

"%p%" <- function(l, r){ # Remember to add arguments!
  paste(l, r)
}

"Good" %p% "job!"
# [1] "Good job!"

> "I" %p% "love" %p% "R!"
# [1] "I love R!"



14: Dates and Times
Dates are represented by the 'Date' class and times are represented by the 'POSIXct' and 'POSIXlt' classes. Internally, dates are stored as the number of days since 1970-01-01 and times are stored as either the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 (for 'POSIXct') or a list of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. (for 'POSIXlt').

d1 <- Sys.Date() # get the current date

> class(d1)
# [1] "Date"

# We can use the unclass() function to see what d1 looks like internally.
> unclass(d1)
# [1] 18067 # the exact number of days since 1970-01-01!

> d1
# [1] "2019-06-20"

# What if we need to reference a date prior to 1970-01-01?
d2 <- as.Date("1969-01-01")
> unclass(d2)
# [1] -365 # since <1969-01-01> is exactly one calendar year (i.e. 365 days) BEFORE 1970-01-01.


t1 <- Sys.time() # current date and time
> t1
# [1] "2019-06-20 11:10:42 PKT"

> class(t1)
# [1] "POSIXct" "POSIXt" 

# As mentioned earlier, POSIXct is just one of two ways that R represents time information. (You can ignore the second value above, POSIXt, which just functions as a common language between POSIXct and POSIXlt.)


> unclass(t1)
# [1] 1561011043 # number of seconds since the beginning of 1970.

# By default, Sys.time() returns an object of class POSIXct, but we can coerce the result to POSIXlt with as.POSIXlt(Sys.time())

> t2 <- as.POSIXlt(Sys.time())
> class(t2)
# [1] "POSIXlt" "POSIXt"

> t2
# [1] "2019-06-20 11:27:49 PKT"

# The printed format of t2 is identical to that of t1. Now unclass() t2 to see how it is different internally.
