# As we've seen, sapply() always attempts to simplify the result given by lapply(). It has been successful in doing so for each of the examples we've looked at so far. Let's look at an example where sapply() can't figure out how to simplify the result and thus returns a list, no different from lapply().


# Occasionally, you may need to apply a function that is not yet defined, thus requiring you to write your own.
lapply(unique_vals, function(elem) elem[2]) # return a list containing the second item from each element of the unique_vals list.



11: vapply and tapply
# In the last lesson, you learned about the two most fundamental members of R's *apply family of functions: lapply() and sapply(). Both take a list as input, apply a function to each element of the list, then combine and return the result. lapply() always returns a list, whereas sapply() attempts to simplify the result.
