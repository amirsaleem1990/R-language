1: Principles of Analytic Graphs

# Graphs give us a visual form of data, and the first principle of analytic graphs is to show some comparison. You'll hear more about this when you study statistical inference (another great course BTW), but evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing or alternative hypothesis.



# When presented with a claim that something is good, you should always ask "Compared to What?" This is why in commercials you often hear the phrase "other leading brands". An implicit comparison, right?

# the first principle was to show a comparison. The second principle is to show causality or a mechanism of how your theory of the data works. This explanation or systematic structure shows your causal framework for thinking about the question you're trying to answer.
